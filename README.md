# Project-Management-Dashboard---Power-BI

The Project Management Dashboard gives us deep insights into the Total Project Pipeline, Completion Rate per phase, detailed summary of the number of projects undertaken by the organization, and Benefits generated by projects. It provides unique insights into project progress that allows organizations to complete projects within a specific Time, Budget, and Scope by increasing the overall quality of the project. It acts as a one-stop shop for all your project-related informational needs.
